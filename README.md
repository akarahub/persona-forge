Anime Image Generation

This script implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow/Keras to generate images of Pokemon. The core functionality involves training a generator and discriminator to learn the distribution of Pokemon images and produce realistic-looking images from random noise. The script leverages a combined model for efficient training and includes logging and data preprocessing steps. The use of LeakyReLU activation functions and BatchNormalization promotes faster convergence and better results. The script uses a tanh activation function for the final layer of the generator to ensure outputs range between -1 and 1.
